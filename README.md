# Giftastic

This app features an array of buttons.

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.


When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.


Under every gif, the rating (PG, G, so on) is displayed.

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.


This page also includes a form that takes the value from a user input box and adds it the array of buttons on the webpage.
